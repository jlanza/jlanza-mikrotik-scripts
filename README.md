# MikroTik RouterOS Scripts

[RouterOS](https://mikrotik.com/software) is the operating system developed by [MikroTik](https://mikrotik.com/aboutus) for networking tasks. This repository holds a number of [scripts](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Scripting) to manage RouterOS devices.

The scripts have been tested on a [hAP ax<sup>2</sup>](https://mikrotik.com/product/hap_ax2), but should be working on other devices with minimum modifications.
